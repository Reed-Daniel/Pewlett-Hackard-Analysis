# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to assist Pewlett-Hackard with compiling employee data from multiple source files in order to create an employee database that can assist the company in preparing for a potential wave of retirements. With the assistance from our database, Pewlett-Hackard will be able to determine the number of employees eligible for retirement, the total job vacancies that would need to be backfilled, and the amount of young employees eligible for the Mentorship Program.

## Results
### Employees Eligible for Retirement
- Out of Pewlett-Hackard's **300,024** employees, about **30% (90,398)** of the workforce are eligible to receive retirement packages
- The pool of potential retirees consists primarily of employees in senior positions **(Senior Engineer and Senior Staff)**
- The **Development and Production** departments stand to lose the most employees

## Analysis Summary
Based on our analysis findings, we can conclude that Pewlett-Hackard is facing potentially over 90,000 job vacancies company wide. Although a max exodus would put the company in a bind in terms of their overall workforce, the large pool of retirement-ready employees bodes well for the Mentorship Program as there are plenty of resources available to help train the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees. Regardless of the participation in the program, the low number of mentorship eligible employees still leaves Pewlett-Hackard with a significant deficit if the "Silver Tsunami" takes effect and the majority of their older employees separate from the company at the same time.
